## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a valuable way.

This repository showcases various NLP projects that demonstrate different aspects of NLP, including statistical models, text classification, and techniques used to build effective models.

## Projects

### Techniques to Clean the Corpus

Implemented techniques to clean the corpus and extract important information. For example, in our case, we wanted to identify names and dialogue.

### Models from Scratch

Built a statistical model on a given corpus. The goal was to understand the underlying structure of the text data and implement various NLP techniques from scratch.

### Text Classification

Classified text into different categories using machine learning algorithms. Explored different feature extraction methods and classification techniques.

### Sentence Representation and Comparison

Used Word2Vec to represent words and created embeddings for each sentence to check if two sentences are similar enough to replace each other. 

- Used this model to complete sentences.
- Used this model for text classification.
- Compared the results with the Albert model to evaluate the performance.
